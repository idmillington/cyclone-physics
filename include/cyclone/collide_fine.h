/**
 * @file
 *
 * This file contains the fine grained collision detection system.
 * It is used to return contacts between pairs of primitives.
 *
 * There are two groups of tests in this file. Intersection tests
 * use the fastest separating axis method to check if two objects
 * intersect, and the collision tests generate the contacts. The
 * collision tests typically use the intersection tests as an early
 * out.
